Korean L2 Learner Dependency Treebank

- We introduce a manually annotated syntactic treebank based on Universal Dependencies, derived from the written data of second language (L2) Korean learners. In developing this new dataset, we critically evaluated previous works and revised the annotation guidelines to better reflect the linguistic properties of Korean and the characteristics of L2 learners. The L2 Korean Treebank encompasses 7,530 sentences.
- The related paper is planned for publication at the [LREC-COLING-2024 conference](https://lrec-coling-2024.org).
- *More information about the dataset and the corpus will be provided soon..*
